# 3D Printing Software
Imagine that you are able to connect multiple 3D printers together in a network. Efficiency improvements are related to a queue management system that sends large prints to large format 3D printers and smaller prints to small 3D printers. 

The initial roll out of the software solution will have the option to integrate octoprint into the workflow.
